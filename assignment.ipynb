        "1.What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified effectively. They are important because they provide the means for organizing large amounts of data, making it easier and faster to perform operations like searching, inserting, updating, and deleting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable types can be changed after creation. Example: Lists, sets, and dictionaries in Python are mutable because you can modify, add, or remove elements.\n",
        "Immutable types cannot be changed once created. Example: Strings, tuples, and integers in Python are immutable. If you try to change an immutable object, a new object is created.\n",
        "3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable (can be modified after creation), can contain any data type, and are denoted by square brackets [].\n",
        "Tuples are immutable (cannot be modified once created), often used for fixed collections of items, and are denoted by parentheses ().\n",
        "4.Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. Each key maps to a corresponding value, and the keys must be unique. They are implemented as hash tables, which allow for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions. Example: my_dict = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        " A set is used when you need an unordered collection of unique items. Sets automatically eliminate duplicates and offer fast membership testing (checking if an item is in the set). If you don't care about the order or duplication of items, sets are more efficient than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. Unlike lists, strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change their characters once they are created. Lists, on the other hand, are mutable and can contain different types of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python? Tuples are immutable, which means once created, their elements cannot be modified, deleted, or added. This immutability guarantees that the data remains unchanged, providing data integrity, especially in cases where the data should not be altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an associative array format, where keys are hashed to determine their index in the table. Python's dictionaries use hash tables to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently, making lookup operations fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.Can lists contain different data types in Python? Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and other objects. Example: my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14].\n",
        "\n",
        "10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        " Strings are immutable to ensure that their values remain consistent and reliable throughout their usage. Immutability also allows for optimizations, such as memory sharing, where multiple references to the same string use the same memory location, improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "Dictionaries provide fast lookups based on keys, making them ideal for tasks like mapping values to specific identifiers. In contrast, lists require sequential search, which is slower. When you need to associate values with unique identifiers, dictionaries are much more efficient than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "If you have a collection of data that should not be modified (e.g., geographical coordinates), a tuple is preferable because it is immutable and ensures that the data cannot be altered accidentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        " Sets automatically eliminate duplicates. If you try to add a duplicate value to a set, it will not be included. Example: my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3} results in {1, 2, 3}.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "For lists, \"in\" checks if an element exists in the list.\n",
        "For dictionaries, \"in\" checks if a key exists in the dictionary (not the value). Example: key in my_dict returns True if the key exists.\n",
        "15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple?\n",
        "Explain why or why not. No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. This ensures that the data they store cannot be changed accidentally, which is useful in cases where data integrity is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries. Example: {\"person\": {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}}. A use case could be storing multiple attributes for a group of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "The average time complexity of accessing an element in a dictionary is O(1), meaning it takes constant time to retrieve the value associated with a given key due to the underlying hash table implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "Lists are preferred when the order of elements matters, or when you need to store a collection of items without associating them with unique keys. Lists are also more appropriate when you need to iterate over the elements or perform operations that involve positional indexing.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Dictionaries are unordered because the keys are stored in a hash table, which does not guarantee any specific order. This means that when iterating through a dictionary, the items may not appear in the order they were added, although starting from Python 3.7, insertion order is preserved (though still considered unordered in concept).\n",
        "\n",
        "20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a list, data is accessed via an index (e.g., my_list[0]).\n",
        "In a dictionary, data is accessed via a key (e.g., my_dict[\"key\"]). Lists are suitable when the order is important, while dictionaries are ideal when you need to retrieve values associated with specific keys."
